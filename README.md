# Challenge 2

## Description

This project is the beginnings of a professional portfolio for me to use to showcase my skills and talents. It will in time hold completed projects with proper images once they are added. 

Having a site compiling my best work and achievements will be beneficial when searching for employements and could also be used to share with colleagues to see sample work. 

Working on this project has helped teach me patience and to give myself grace in this time that I am learning. I will not have a perfect looking portfolio this week but will will be a fantastic starting point for me. I will always be able to come back and adjust colors, images, and content as my skills grow. 

The page may not do exactly what I want it to do yet, but in time I have confidence that it will.

## Credits

My tutor Jose (Vinnie) Lopez was able to help me better focus on the pieces not as a whole but in smaller aspects. It was very helpful to get in that mindset and the project was able to approached more efficiently.
